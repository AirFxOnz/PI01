The .STL and .SLDPRT files that we used during our modding process are available in the corresponding folders.

Please note that these parts are designed for a Tronxy X5S printer, as well as a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Raspberry Pi AI camera.

If you have the same setup, you can print the STL files directly; otherwise, the SolidWorks files are provided so that you can modify them according to your needs.

The support arms are available in two versions: one as a single piece and another split into two parts so they can be printed separately.

For the brush holder, we glued/screwed three toothbrush heads that we had cut beforehand.
